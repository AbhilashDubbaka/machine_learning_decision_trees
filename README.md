# Decision Trees Coursework

This machine learning coursework on decision trees was completed as part of MSc Computing Science at Imperial College London.

## How to run our code

1) Input the path to your own dataset in ```main.py``` (we are expecting a text file).
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    np.random.seed(2)
    
    # LOAD DATASET
    dataset = np.loadtxt([THE DIRECTORY TO YOUR DATASET])

```

2) Run ```python main.py```
